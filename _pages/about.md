Hi, I'm Adrien Ecoffet. I am a research scientist at OpenAI, currently working on scaling large language models. In the past, I have also done research in reinforcement learning and AI safety.

Prior to OpenAI, I was an AI resident and then a research scientist at Uber AI Labs. Before my research career, I was a software engineer at Quora.
