Hi, I'm Adrien Ecoffet. I am a research scientist at OpenAI.

My research interests are reinforcement learning (particularly exploration and quality-diversity inspired approaches) and AI safety (particularly moral alignment). More recently I have been researching emergent complexity in multi-agent environments.

Prior to OpenAI, I was an AI resident (supervised by Jeff Clune and Kenneth O. Stanley) and then a research scientist (managed by Joel Lehman) at Uber AI Labs. Before transitioning to a research career, I was a software engineer at Quora.
