I am an AI research scientist at OpenAI, formerly at Uber AI Labs.

My research interests are Reinforcement Learning (particularly exploration and quality-diversity inspired methods) and AI Safety (particularly moral alignment).

More recently I have focused on emergent complexity from multi-agent interaction.
