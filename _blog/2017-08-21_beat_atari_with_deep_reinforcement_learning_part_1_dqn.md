In this post, we will attempt to reproduce the following paper by DeepMind: Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning, which introduces the notion of a Deep Q-Network.

I strongly recommend that you skim through the paper before reading this tutorial, and then read it more deeply when you are done. I will be quoting it throughout. Further, I recommend you really do try to implement your DQN from what I am writing here.
